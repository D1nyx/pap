# The following line prevents the package from being accidentally published to
# pub.dev using `flutter pub publish`. This is preferred for private packages.
publish_to: 'none' # Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev

# Version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the build number may be overridden in flutter build
# by specifying --build-name and --build-number.
# In Android, build-name is versionName while build-number is versionCode.
# In iOS, build-name is CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is CFBundleVersion.
# In Windows, build-name is the major, minor, and patch parts, and build-number is the build suffix.
